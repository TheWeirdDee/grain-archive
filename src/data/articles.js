            <p>The music of drifting cinema is a language of silence and light. How we find meaning in the gaps between frames.</p>
            <h3>The Sound of Silence</h3>
            <p>In the world of slow cinema, sound is often as important as the image itself. We explore the subtle textures and ambient soundscapes that define this genre.</p>
            <h3>Visual Rhythms</h3>
            <p>How do we perceive time when the camera refuses to move? The rhythmic quality of long takes and the emotional weight of sustained attention.</p>

            <p>The return of the wall of sound. How a new generation of musicians is embracing the grit, the noise, and the warmth of distortion.</p>
            <h3>From screamers, not just volume</h3>
            <p>There are types of distortion that purely rely on an interaction between the instrument's circuit and return. The decay of sound creates feedback as another layer of player interaction; it's a hell-driven, tone-first philosophy of distortion that we see now, instead of people aiming for the clean rot of music's screaming output — we think sound is around for why you cause, not just making it.</p>
            <p>When a guitar is driven beyond its tolerance and forced to push back at logic, the result is a blur, fuzzy and granular, using the circuit itself as an electric instrument — turning clear notes into rough-hewn rectangular waves. This isn't just a style; it's a physical state of sound.</p>
            <h3>Pedals on pedals: the gear walnut</h3>
            <p>Fuzz worship has always been intertwined with the obsession of the boards. Custom circuits are traded like rare coins, evoking the ghosts of the big muff era with a boxy, thick, and almost physical presence that cannot be digitally replicated.</p>
            <p>On YouTube and Instagram, fuzz fanaticism is more than just about the sounds, but the aesthetic of the gear itself. Pedalboards are built from wood, finished with wax, and covered in pedals. These are more than just gear; they are tools of expression.</p>
            <h3>Why now?</h3>
            <p>The rise of digital clean is creating an opposite reaction. After years of pristine audio production and DAW-led perfection, there's a return to the tactile and the messy. Fuzz is the perfect antidote to the algorithmic polish. It has heart, soul, and a sense of unpredictability.</p>
